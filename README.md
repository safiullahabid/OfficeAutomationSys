# OfficeAutomationSys
Corporate Sector Office automation system, which basically automate the mailing and marking system with in a huge level organization.

Nice — this is a great project scope. I’ve rewritten your requirements into a clear, detailed, point-wise specification you can hand to a code generator (or a dev team like “claud”) — and I’ve added concrete technology recommendations, a complete database structure (tables + important columns), a full application architecture tree, and extra Office-automation features you might want. Where it matters I also recommend libraries and explain tradeoffs (with up-to-date references).

# 1 — High-level goal (rephrased)

Build a secure, enterprise-grade **Documents & Mail Management System** (web application) for a corporate housing-colony organization. The system will store, version, search, route and notify users about documents (letters, memos, minisheets, attachments, spreadsheets, presentations), support multi-role users and multiple official IDs per person, preserve data via soft-deletes and audits, and integrate factory/office workflows (approval, marking, distribution). The app will be developed in Java (JDK 21) with JSF for the UI and Oracle as the RDBMS.

---

# 2 — Target tech stack (recommended)

* Backend Java runtime: **Java JDK 21** (LTS).
* Web UI: **JSF** (use PrimeFaces component library for fast enterprise widgets — compatible with modern Java 11+ stacks). ([GitHub][1])
* CSS/UI framework: **Bootstrap** (recommended for corporate look, built components, ease of use with PrimeFaces). Tailwind is an option if you want utility-first styling and a highly custom look; choose Bootstrap for faster delivery.
* JSON library: **Jackson** (recommended for performance, modules and wide ecosystem). Jackson has better streaming/advanced features vs older options like Gson. ([DZone][2])
* DB access / persistence: **JPA (Hibernate)** as primary ORM (standard, mature). Optionally use **MyBatis** for a few high-performance, complex SQL modules (reporting, bulk tasks) where you want full control. (Both approaches are industry standard — JPA for most, MyBatis for SQL control.) ([Medium][3])
* Document file handling / Office integration:

  * If budget allows and you need advanced Word/Excel/PPT features (mail-merge, rendering, conversion, stamps, complex formatting), **Aspose (commercial)** is the most feature-complete option. If you want free/open alternatives, combine **Apache POI** (read/write .docx/.xlsx/.pptx) and **docx4j** for more Word features — but some advanced operations require extra effort or are unavailable. Aspose is more feature-rich/stable for advanced office automation. ([Aspose Documentation][4])
  * For web editing/viewing: consider **OnlyOffice** or **Microsoft Office Online** integration (for true in-browser editing) or a modern rich text editor for letters (CKEditor 5 or TinyMCE) for HTML/RTF style editing.
* Authentication / SSO: **LDAP / Active Directory** integration (for corporate environment). Optionally use **OAuth2 / OIDC** if external SSO required.
* Search: Oracle Text for DB-side full text search or Elasticsearch as a separate search engine if you need powerful multi-index search & analytics.
* Build & deployment: Maven or Gradle; run on Tomcat, WildFly, or Jakarta EE server as you prefer. Eclipse IDE for development (you mentioned Eclipse).

# 3 — Which DB access approach I recommend (short)

Use **JPA (Hibernate)** as the primary persistence layer for standard CRUD, object mapping, caching, and transaction management. For modules that require hand-tuned SQL (complex reports, large data imports/exports, bulk updates), create a small MyBatis layer or use native queries in JPA. This gives best developer productivity and maintainability while preserving SQL control where needed. ([Medium][3])

**Soft-delete / retention:** implement soft-delete flags (`is_deleted` / `status`) + `deleted_at` + `deleted_by` and periodic archiving — do not physically delete rows.

---

# 4 — Document processing: Aspose vs open source (recommendation)

* **Aspose**: commercial, full features (document generation, conversion, mail-merge, rendering, image export, watermarking, PDF conversion). Best if budget allows and you need robust Word/Excel/PPT features without re-engineering. ([Aspose Documentation][4])
* **Open source combo**: **Apache POI** + **docx4j** + **pdfbox** for PDF tasks. Good when budget constrained but expect more coding for advanced features and edge cases. Apache POI covers most standard read/write tasks; Aspose covers more advanced operations and has vendor support. ([Stack Overflow][5])

If the main use is corporate letter creation where Word fidelity is important, I’d lean **Aspose** (if you can pay). If you prefer a free stack, accept extra engineering with Apache POI + integrate a web editor (CKEditor) for creating content.

---

# 5 — Extra Office Automation features you should include

(valuable for corporate doc/mail automation)

1. Document templates (versioned) + template fields / mail-merge.
2. Workflow engine: draft → review → approved → dispatched (with countersign).
3. Role-based approvals and multi-sign paths.
4. Document versioning and rollback (full version history + compare).
5. Electronic signatures (support for signing PDFs or metadata signatures).
6. OCR for scanned letters (Tesseract or commercial OCR) to index contents.
7. Document stamping/watermarking (date, user, classification).
8. Auto-routing rules (e.g., if `document.type=Letter` and `dept=Housing`, route to Officer X).
9. Alerts & notifications (in-app toast, email, SMS integration).
10. Retention/archival policies and legal hold (non-deletable until release).
11. Audit trail & immutable logging for important actions.
12. Bulk import/export & archive retrieval.
13. Template driven print layouts / PDF generation.
14. Role-based UI customization and department dashboards.
15. LDAP/AD integration and SSO.
16. API layer (REST) for third-party integrations (mail gateways, mobile apps).

# 6 — Complete database structure (tables + key columns)

Below is a normalized, enterprise-ready schema. Use Oracle datatypes (e.g., `NUMBER`, `VARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`). Add indexes (FKs and search indexes) and Oracle Text where indicated.

> Note: Primary keys use `BIGINT`/`NUMBER(19)` or Oracle `NUMBER` with sequences. Use UUIDs if you prefer globally unique IDs.

> Add required lookup tables: `DOCUMENT_TYPE`, `STATUS_CODES`, `CLASSIFICATIONS`, `MARK_TYPES`, etc.

---

# 7 — Indexing & performance considerations

* Index `document_id`, `document_type`, `status`, `department_id`, `created_at`.
* Create Oracle Text index on text fields (`title`, `summary`, `DOCUMENT_VERSION` full text) for fast search.
* Use LOB/CLOB with proper chunking if storing large content. Prefer file object store (filesystem or object store like S3/MinIO) and store references in DB for large binaries.
* Consider partitioning for very large tables (ARCHIVE partitions by year).

---

# 8 — Application architecture tree (folders / layers)

(Top → bottom; use Maven multi-module project if desired)

* /project-root

  * /webapp (JSF views .xhtml + resources)

    * /pages (home.xhtml, login.xhtml, dashboard.xhtml, documents/\*)
    * /components (facelets templates, header.xhtml, footer.xhtml)
  * /ui (Managed Beans / ViewScoped beans)

    * DocumentBean.java, DashboardBean.java, SearchBean.java
  * /service (business logic)

    * DocumentService.java, NotificationService.java, WorkflowService.java
  * /api (REST endpoints if exposing services)

    * DocumentRestController.java (JAX-RS or Spring REST)
  * /persistence (JPA entities + repositories/DAO)

    * entities/\*.java (Document, DocumentVersion, UserAccount, Person, Role, etc.)
    * repositories/\*.java (Spring Data JPA Repos or JPA DAO)
  * /integration

    * AsposeAdapter.java / ApachePoiAdapter.java (abstracted adapter)
    * MailGateway.java (IMAP/SMTP)

  * /utils (file storage, encryption utils, pdf utils)
  * /batch (scheduled jobs: archive, purge, notifications)
  * /config (application.properties / datasource / jndi)
  * /tests (unit/integration)
  * /scripts (DB migration scripts — Liquibase / Flyway)

---

# 9 — User management module (specifically)

You asked to support **multiple IDs for a single user** (different appointments). Proposed model and behavior:

* **PERSON** is the person entity; **USER\_ACCOUNT** stores multiple login/ID entries bound to `person_id`.
* Each `USER_ACCOUNT` may be associated with one or more **APPOINTMENTS** or **POSTINGS** table:

  * `APPOINTMENT` (`appointment_id`, `person_id`, `department_id`, `role_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `is_active`, `remarks`)
* Permissions apply to `USER_ACCOUNT` (the ID currently used). A person might have multiple active accounts (e.g., current posting and a departmental special role). The UI should let the person switch active account context or maintain role scopes.
* Support mapping of `user_id` → `person_id` (1\:N), and then `person_id` → `appointments` (1\:N). This allows multiple official IDs per person across different appointments.

---

# 10 — Home page / Dashboard requirements (rephrased)

Dashboard should be high-value & decision-focused (single page contains key items):

* Summary tiles: total documents, pending for me (action required), awaiting my approval, recently received (last 7 days), overdue items.
* Charts: Top document types; department-wise incoming volume (single pie chart as requested).
* Quick list: Documents marked to me (distinct view), urgent items, drafts I own.
* Alerts area: unread notifications (letters, minisheets), system messages.
* Shortcuts: “Create Letter”, “Upload Document”, “Mark Document”, “Start Workflow”.
* Activity feed: recent documents, route logs, approvals.
* Search box with advanced filters (type, date range, department, sender, full-text).

---

# 11 — Alerts / Notification behavior

* In-app real-time alerts (WebSocket / Push) for new mail or documents marked to the user.
* Fallback: email notification (SMTP) and optionally SMS. Support digest vs instant preferences.
* Notification retention & read/unread state stored in `NOTIFICATION` table.

---

# 12 — Security, audit & compliance

* Authentication: LDAP/AD or local accounts with strong password policy. Use password hashing (bcrypt).
* Authorization: RBAC (roles + permissions), plus department-level constraints.
* Audit: record all CRUD + workflow actions in `AUDIT_LOG`.
* Data protection: encrypt sensitive fields at rest (e.g., document classification metadata), use TLS in transit.
* Retention & legal hold: prevent physical delete while `is_locked` or under legal hold.

---

# 13 — Deployment & operations

* CI/CD: Jenkins/GitLab Actions/Azure DevOps with Maven/Gradle build and DB migration (Flyway/Liquibase).
* Monitor: Application logging (structured logging), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana if possible).
* Backups: DB backup + file store backup; retention policy and restore tested.
* Scaling: stateless app servers, shared DB; consider object store for attachments.

---

# 14 — Minimal viable features (MVP) to build first

1. User auth (LDAP + local), user & role admin.
2. Create / upload a document + attach file + versioning.
3. Mark document to user/department (document marking table).
4. Dashboard: show items marked to logged user + counts.
5. Notifications (in-app + email).
6. Basic search (by metadata) and document view (download).
7. Soft-delete and audit log.

---

# 15 — Suggested implementation choices (short list)

* **UI**: JSF + PrimeFaces + Bootstrap. ([PrimeFaces][6])
* **JSON**: Jackson. ([DZone][2])
* **ORM**: JPA (Hibernate); use MyBatis selectively for complex SQL. ([Medium][3])
* **Office files**: Aspose if budget allows; otherwise Apache POI + docx4j + OnlyOffice for web editing. ([Aspose Documentation][4])

---

# 16 — Deliverables you can hand to “claud” (or dev team)

1. This point-wise requirements document (use the sections above).
2. The DB schema DDL (I can produce full Oracle DDL with sequences, constraints, indexes if you want).
3. A first iteration architecture diagram (I can draw a simple block diagram).
4. Example JPA entities + sample JSF pages (starter templates).
5. Integration adapters for Aspose/Apache POI and a config doc explaining how to switch adapters by property.

---

# 17 — Quick notes / tradeoffs

* **PrimeFaces + Bootstrap** speeds UI delivery for enterprise apps; Tailwind is more modern but needs more design work. ([PrimeFaces][6])
* **Aspose** will save dev time for complex document operations but is commercial. Apache POI is free but requires more engineering for advanced features. ([Aspose Documentation][4])
* **JPA + Hibernate** gives faster development. Add MyBatis for specialized queries when profiling shows JPA is too slow. ([Medium][3])
